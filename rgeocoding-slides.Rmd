- start a new R script file

- set your working directory to the location of the unzipped files


## Introductions

About me

About you - why are you  here?


## Workshop Overview

- Intro to Geocoding
- Review of Geocoding tools
- Geocoding in R with `ggmap`

## Types of places you can Geocode

- state, city, building, 
- street address or intersection, 
- named place (eg mountain), landmark,
- crime or other event location,
- zip code, etc.

## Why Geocode?

- Display locations on a map

- Link locations to other data

- Spatial analysis
    - Calculate distance, direction, area, etc.
    - Identify patterns & relationships:
        - clusters, outliers, neighbors

## Geocoding Components

`File of Input locations`

- places of the same type in a standard format


`A Geocoder`

- Software and a reference database
- The software compares input locations to database & returns matches


`Output file`

- Geographic coordinates for each matched input location
- Metadata about the match

## Reference Databases

What types of data are available/ should be used for matching

- Rooftop
- Parcel
- Street Addresses
- Street Address Range
- Street, City, Zipcode, State

## Dual Address Range

Where do you think the point for `275 5th St NE` would be located?

<img width="600px" src="http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.5/manage-data/geocoding/GUID-FB88E418-2955-45A2-934D-35182D3568C4-web.png"></img>

## Dual Address Range

Where do you think the point for `275 5th St NE` would be located?

<img width="500px" src="./screenshots/dual_address_match.png"></img>


## Parcel & Rooftop Reference Database

Addresses would match to centroid of parcel or rooftop

## Geocoding Workflow

- Consider your needs & options
- Choose geocoder
- Preprocess / clean your input data
- Geocode
- Evaluate your output
- Postprocess as needed

## Considerations

- Geographic & temporal scope
- Output type and quality
- Volume / speed
- Security
- Costs of software and data
- Ease of use

# Geocoding Practice

## Open these geocoding tools in 3 different browser windows

[Google Maps](https://maps.google.com)

[ESRI World Geocoding Service](https://developers.arcgis.com/features/geocoding/)

[US Census Geocoding Tool](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/locations/onelineaddress?form)


## Compare results

Geocode the following address in all three tools:

`2625 Dana St, Berkeley, CA, 94704`


# Geocoding in R

## Geocoding with `ggmap`

This has been the most common R package for geocoding.

But, beginning July 2018 Google changed its pricing model.

For API access you need to register a `credit card` with Google

- $200 worth of free API services per month

- That's 40,000 geocoded locations

See the [Google Geocoding API Documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) for details

## Geocoding with `ggmap`

Worth the trouble because output is great quality.

But only if you can afford the costs!

Let's try it.

## `ggmap`

Load the library

```{r, eval = T}
library(ggmap)
```

## `ggmap`

Register your API key
```{r}
#mykey <- "AIzaSyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxOQyOFWrTw"
mykey <- "AIzaSyDf-SZG8O4hj1c06VQ-k6hkBrOQyOFWrTw"
register_google(key=mykey)

```

## Geocode a city

```{r, eval=F}
geocode("San Francisco, CA")
```

## Geocode a state
```{r, eval=F}
geocode("California")
```

## Geocode a landmark

```{r, eval=F}
geocode("Golden Gate Bridge")
```

## More detailed output
```{r, eval=F}
geocode("Golden Gate Bridge", output="more")
```

## Reverse Geocode

```{r, eval=F}
revgeocode(c(-122.4194,37.77493), output="more")
```

## Geocode an address

```{r, eval=F}
geocode_ouput <-geocode("2625 Dana St, Berkeley CA, 94704", output="more")
```

## "Batch" Geocode

Geocode a set of places at once.

Usually means you upload the entire file to the geocoder.  

This is much faster but not supported by most online services

With `ggmap::geocode` we serial process the set in one command.

## Read in file of addesses

```{r}
# File of addresses
address_data <- read.csv("address_data/oak_liquor_stores.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)

# Take a look
head(address_data)
```

## Format addresses

Many online services want a single column with the address data, like
`"2625 Dana St, Berkeley CA, 94704"`

```{r}

address_data$full_address <- paste0(address_data$street, ", " , 
                                    address_data$city, ", " , 
                                    address_data$state, " ", 
                                    address_data$zip)

# Take a look
head(address_data, 3)
```

## Ready to geocode

```{r}
google_geocoded <- geocode(address_data$full_address, output = "more", 
                           source = "google", key=mykey)
```

## View results

Google returns a lot of metadata - see documentation
```{r}
head(google_geocoded)
```

## Add Geocoded results to input file

```{r}
# Add geocoded points to input data frame
# - works because num rows & row order returned by geocoder the same
address_data$glon <- google_geocoded$lon
address_data$glat <- google_geocoded$lat

head(address_data, 3)  # take a look
```

## Map results with Leaflet

```{r}
library(leaflet)

point_map <- leaflet(address_data) %>%
  addTiles() %>%   
  addMarkers(lat=~glat, lng=~glon, 
            popup=(paste0(address_data$name, "</br>",
                          address_data$full_address)
            )
  )

```

## Display the map

```{r}
point_map
```

# ESRI World Geocoding Service

## ESRI World Geocoding Service

UC Berkeley has an ESRI Site licence

So we can use the World Geocoding Service for free.

This is a great value as geocoding is expensive!

## ESRI World Geocoding Service

In order to access the `World Geocoding Service` you need to first get an API key.

ESRI calls this an `access token`.

Instructions for this are on page 15 of [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JGMW0Lk3FnOPjGVxCQCFMT4SwHio239z-Yb8qdlEs6k/edit?usp=sharing).

Let's try it!

## ESRI WGS Access Token

You can use the token below for this workshop. 

`Tokens` are temporary

- By default, a token expires in `2 hours`. 
- Add an expiration parameter when requesting a token to receive one that is valid for a shorter or longer period of time. 
- The maximum lifetime of a token is `14 days` even if you specify a longer expiration period.

## ESRI WGS Token

<img width="700px" src="./screenshots/esri_wgs_token.png"></img>

## ESRI WGS Token

Your token should look something like this:
```{r}
my_esri_token <- "iNFc0fq6bGlj6mUfptHgEGEjVeKZ0T5EPNAkVjgxBotwDaXxgykmwDNR0AkEvPi8Sh0QESWgt0IhmsbbO5UA3H-b2_T5yzhn1fW--WwD2O-7V2gbGCEaF4jg38dUQ7LhpTBT_XqYy0vV7Mw_e2hWUA.."

```

## Functions for Geocoding with the ESRI WGS

Two functions: `geocode_one` and `geocode_many`

These functions are long and ugly.

You can reference them by `sourcing` this script.

Take a look at the file on your computer

```{r}
source("./scripts/esri_wgs_geocoding.R")
```

## Geocode One Address

```{r}
geocode_one("2625 Dana St, Berkeley, CA, 94704", my_esri_token, 
            postal = TRUE)
```

## Geocode Many

```{r}
# Batch geocode your dataframe of addresses with the following function
esri_geocoded <- geocode_many(address_data$id, address_data$street, 
                              address_data$city, address_data$state, 
                              as.character(address_data$zip), my_esri_token)
```

## Take a look at results

ESRI WGS also returns a lot of metadata
```{r}
head(esri_geocoded, 3)
```

## Add ESRI WGS Results to input data

```{r}
address_data <- merge(address_data, esri_geocoded[c("ID","lon","lat")], 
                      by.x="id",by.y = "ID", all.x = T)

# Take a look
head(address_data, 3)
```

## Map geocoded data with `Leaflet`

```{r}
point_map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%   
  addMarkers(lat=address_data$glat, lng=address_data$glon, 
            popup=(paste0(address_data$name, "</br>",
                          address_data$full_address)) 
            ) %>%   
  addCircleMarkers(lat=address_data$lat, lng=address_data$lon,
            color="black",fillColor="red",
            popup=(paste0(address_data$name, "</br>",
                          address_data$full_address))
  )
```

## Display the map

```{r}
point_map
```


## Geocoding Historic Locations

Good question!


##  Save output to file

You don't want to re-geocode!
```{r, eval=F}
write.csv(google_geocoded,file="output/address_data_geocoded_google.csv", 
          row.names=FALSE)

write.csv(esri_geocoded,file="output/address_data_geocoded_esri.csv", 
          row.names=FALSE)

```

 
# Geocoding Results

## Assessing Output Quality

- Map the results

- Examine the range of coordinates
    - CA: -124, 32, -114, 42

- Review output data & metadata
    - specific to the geocoder


## Geocoding Output

- With a little preprocessing most reliable geocoders will be able to geocode 80% or more of your addresses within a street block of the actual location.
    - based on my my experience!
    - assumes US addresses.

- Cleaning and standardizing addresses can be a lot of work!
    - unlikely to get it perfect

## Standardize Addresses
- provide all components
- remove unnecessary components
- remove duplicates 
- remove extra spaces or commas
- remove odd characters like “#” “/”, “@”
- standardize capitalization

## Standardize Addresses

- Intersections
    - Corner of Main and Long Ave should be **Main & Long**
- Numbered Streets
    - Fourth St should be **4th St**
- Directional Prefixes
    - North, No, N., etc should be **N**
- Apartment numbers and letters
    - Remove them!
- Use **PO Box**
    - unless you have the address!

## Use Standard Abbreviations
|Use|For These|
|----------------|----------------------------|
|HWY|Highway|
|LN|Lane|
|DR| Drive|
|EXPY|Expressway|

 
## Problems in Reference Database
- Incorrect street ranges
- Inaccurate or low quality features 
- Inaccurate feature attributes

- Missing streets
- Address changes

## Output Quality &  Population Density

# Linking to Census Data

## Linking to Census Data

The [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov) has been collecting data about the US population since 1790!

Survey data from the decennial census and the 5 year American Community Survey are two of the most commonly used databases.

Publicly available census data are aggregated to census geographies.

## Census Geographies

<img width="700px" src="./screenshots/census_geo.png"></img>

## Census Data

Census data are linked to Census geographies by IDs called `FIPS Codes` or `GEOIDs`

<img width="700px" src="./screenshots/social_explorer.png"></img>

## Census FIPS Codes / GEOIDs

<img width="500px" src="./screenshots/fips_code.png"></img>

## Linking points to census data

In order to link geocoded points to census data you need to get the census geographic FIPS codes for the points.

There are a number of ways to do this.

## Important Note

Census geographies can change every 10 years due to changes in the population.

For example,

- if the population of an area increases, census tracts can split

- if the population of an area decreases, tracts can merge

This makes comparisons between censuses more complicated.

- You need to get the correct census identifiers for the year(s) of interest

## US Census Geocoding Service

If you geocode with the [US Census Geocoding Service](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/) you can get the census IDs from the geocoder.

Try that with "2625 Dana St, Berkeley, CA, 94704"

## FCC Census Block API

Provides an programming interface for fetching the 2010 Block FIPS code

[https://geo.fcc.gov/api/census/#!/block/get_block_find](https://geo.fcc.gov/api/census/#!/block/get_block_find)

```
https://geo.fcc.gov/api/census/block/find?latitude=37.85256200000
       &longitude=-122.2736340&showall=true&format=json>
```

## FCC Block API

Source the script file to load the function

`latlon2fips`

Then try it  with `-122.273634, 37.852562`

```{r}
source("./scripts/fcc_latlon2fips.R")

# test one coordinate pair
latlon2fips(latitude=37.852562, longitude=-122.273634)

```

## Get FIPs for all of our geocoded addresses

Apply the `latlon2fips` function to all rows in our dataframe

Use the coordinates returned by the Google Geocoding API
```{r}

address_data$fips<- mapply(latlon2fips, address_data$glat, 
                           address_data$glon)

# Take a look
head(address_data, 3)

```

## Get FIPS spatially

We can download geographic data from the Census

and then spatially join the geocoded points to the census geographic data

to get the FIPS codes for each point

## Get FIPS spatially

We can use the `tigris` package to download census geographic data.

```{r}
library(sp)
library(tigris)
```

## `tigris`

Set tigris options & download data

```{r}
options(tigris_class = "sp")   # options are sp or sf
options(tigris_use_cache = F)  # set to true to save locally

tracts2010 <- tracts(state = '06', county= '001', cb = F, year=2010)

tracts2000 <- tracts(state = '06', county= '001', cb = F, year=2000)

```

## Plot the tracts

```{r}
plot(tracts2000, border="red")
plot(tracts2010, add=T)
```


## Make address points spatial

Use the `sp` library to convert the address_data to a `SpatialPointsDataFrame`

Then, set the `coordinate reference system`, or `CRS` to be the same as that of the census tracts.

```{r}
address_data_sp<- address_data  #make copy
coordinates(address_data_sp) <-c("glon", "glat")
proj4string(address_data_sp) <- CRS(proj4string(tracts2010))
```

## A word about Geographic Coordinates

The Google Geocoding API returns geographic coordinates referenced to the `World Geodetic System of 1984` or `WGS84`.

Census geographic data are referenced to the `North American Datum of 1983` or `NAD83`. 

These two geographic CRSs can differ by up to 1 meter in the continental USA.

It's up to you to decide if this could impact your spatial analysis.

## Plot the tracts and points

```{r}
plot(tracts2000, border="red")
plot(tracts2010, add=T)
points(address_data_sp, col="green")
```

## Spatial Overlay

The `sp::over` function spatially compares the two input spatial objects and returns the data values for the census tract in which each point is located.

```{r}
fips2000 <- over(address_data_sp, tracts2000)
fips2010 <-over(address_data_sp, tracts2010)

# Uncomment to take a look at the output
#head(fips2000, 3)
#head(fips2010, 3)
```


## Add the FIPS to the address dataframe

```{r}
address_data$GEOID10 <- fips2010$GEOID10
address_data$CTIDFP00 <- fips2000$CTIDFP00

# head(address_data)

```


## Questions?

Discuss the 3 methods for getting the census FIPS codes for the geocoded points.

1. When geocoding

2. Using an API

3. Using spatial overlay


# Fetching Census data

## Fetching Census data

We can take this one step further and retrieve census data for the census tracts of interest.

We do this with the `tidycensus` package

## Get Census Data
```{r}
library(tidycensus)

# Load census key - Patty's key, apply for your own!
my_census_api_key <- "f2d6f4f743545d3a42a67412b05935dc7712c432"

# Make tigris aware of census key
census_api_key(my_census_api_key)
```

## Identify state(s) and county(s) of interest

```{r}
my_states<- c("06") # CA
my_counties <- c("001") # Alameda County
```

## Identify ACS census variables

Our scenario of interest is to identify liquor stores in census tracts with a relatively high population of minors.

So, we want to find the census variables for `total population` and `population under 18`

```{r}
cenvar_table <-load_variables(year=2016, dataset = "acs5", cache=T)

# Take a look at the data frame to find the names of census tables
# This will give you the table and variable codes
# Use "View(cenvar_table)" and filter within the table to get the codes for a specific variable

# View(cenvar_table) 

```

## Census Variables

Indentify the tables and variables of interest in the 5 year ACS Data (2012-2016)
```{r}
pop_total <- "B01001_001E"
pop_under18 <- "B09001_001E"
```

## Fetch Data of interest

```{r}
pop_acs5_2016 <-get_acs(geography = "tract", 
                        variables = c(pop_total,pop_under18), 
                       year=2016, survey="acs5",
                       state = my_states, county = my_counties,
                       geometry = F)

#head(pop_acs5_2016)
```

## Reshape the data

Load libraries
```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```

## Reshape the data

```{r}

# Select the columnbs of interest
# and put `totpop` and `under18` in their own columns
pop2 <- pop_acs5_2016 %>%
  select("GEOID","variable","estimate") %>%
  spread(key=variable, value=estimate)

# Rename columns
colnames(pop2)<-c("GEOID10","totpop","under18")
head(pop2)
```

## Join population data to Address data 

```{r}

pop2$pct_under18 <- round((pop2$under18 / pop2$totpop) * 100, 1)
address_data2 <- merge(address_data, pop2, by="GEOID10", all.x=T)

# Take a look - what do you think?
#head(address_data2)
```

## Join Population data to Census tracts to map

We just joined the census data to the address points.

We can also join it to the census tracts.


```{r}
tracts2010 <- merge(tracts2010, pop2, by="GEOID10")

# Take a look:
# head(tracts2010@data)
```

Note: this is `sp::merge` so we do not reference the `@data` slot!

## Map the data

```{r}
quantColors <- colorQuantile("Reds", tracts2010$pct_under18, n=5)

point_map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%   
  addPolygons(data=tracts2010, 
              color="white", 
              weight=1, 
              opacity=0.5,
              fillColor= ~quantColors(pct_under18),
              fillOpacity = 0.75, 
              popup = paste0("<b>Percent under 18:</b> ", tracts2010$pct_under18, "%")) %>%
  addMarkers(data=address_data, lat=~glat, lng=~glon, 
            popup=(paste0(address_data$name, "</br>",
                          address_data$full_address)
            )
  )
```

## Display the map

```{r}
point_map
```

## Save the output data
```{r}
#write.csv(address_data2, file="output/address_data_geocoded2.csv", row.names=F)
#writeOGR(tracts2010, dsn="./output", layer="tracts2010", driver="ESRI Shapefile")
```
